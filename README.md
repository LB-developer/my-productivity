# **Productivity Dashboard**

## **Overview**

This project is a full-stack web application featuring a **Go** backend and a **React** frontend. It is currently under active development, with ongoing improvements and feature additions. The primary goal is to integrate modern backend and frontend technologies to create a robust personal productivity tracker.

## **Key Features**

- **Go Backend:**
  - RESTful API with routing managed by `chi`.
  
- **React Frontend:**
  - Data fetching and state management powered by React Query.

## **Development Status**

This project is under active development. New features and improvements are added regularly, with progress documented through commit history.

This project began as an exploration of using a new backend language to build a portfolio. The scope then shifted to creating a portfolio generator to better align with the backend structure. However, as the project evolved, the portfolio generator concept no longer fit, and the code is now being repurposed into a personal productivity tracker.

### **Current Progress**

- [x] Established communication between Go backend and React frontend.
- [x] Implemented basic API routes in Go.
- [x] Set up data fetching and state management in React using React Query.

### **Future Goals**

- [] Refactor current code to become a personal productivity tracker.
